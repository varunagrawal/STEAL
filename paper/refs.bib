    abstract = 	 {Complex manipulation tasks often require non-trivial and coordinated movements of different parts of a robot. In this work, we address the challenges associated with learning and reproducing the skills required to execute such complex tasks. Specifically, we decompose a task into multiple subtasks and learn to reproduce the subtasks by learning stable policies from demonstrations. By leveraging the RMPflow framework for motion generation, our approach finds a stable global policy in the configuration space that enables simultaneous execution of various learned subtasks. The resulting global policy is a weighted combination of the learned policies such that the motions are coordinated and feasible under the robot’s kinematic and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the necessity and efficacy of the proposed approach in the context of multiple constrained manipulation tasks performed by a Franka Emika robot.}

    abstract="Given the continuous stream of movements that biological systems exhibit in their daily activities, an account for such versatility and creativity has to assume that movement sequences consist of segments, executed either in sequence or with partial or complete overlap. Therefore, a fundamental question that has pervaded research in motor control both in artificial and biological systems revolves around identifying movement primitives (a.k.a. units of actions, basis behaviors, motor schemas, etc.). What are the fundamental building blocks that are strung together, adapted to, and created for ever new behaviors? This paper summarizes results that led to the hypothesis of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP). DMPs are units of action that are formalized as stable nonlinear attractor systems. They are useful for autonomous robotics as they are highly flexible in creating complex rhythmic (e.g., locomotion) and discrete (e.g., a tennis swing) behaviors that can quickly be adapted to the inevitable perturbations of a dynamically changing, stochastic environment. Moreover, DMPs provide a formal framework that also lends itself to investigations in computational neuroscience. A recent finding that allows creating DMPs with the help of well-understood statistical learning methods has elevated DMPs from a more heuristic to a principled modeling approach. Theoretical insights, evaluations on a humanoid robot, and behavioral and brain imaging data will serve to outline the framework of DMPs for a general approach to motor control in robotics and biology.",

    abstract = {We consider the problem of devising a unified control policy capable of regulating both the robot motion and its physical interaction with the environment. We formulate this control policy by a non-parametric potential function and a dissipative field, which both can be learned from human demonstrations. We show that the robot motion and its stiffness behaviors can be encapsulated by the potential function's gradient and curvature, respectively. The dissipative field can also be used to model desired damping behavior throughout the motion, hence generating motions that follows the same velocity profile as the demonstrations. The proposed controller can be realized as a unification approach between "realtime motion generation" and "variable impedance control", with the advantages that it has guaranteed stability as well as does not rely on following a reference trajectory. Our approach, called unified motion and variable impedance control (UMIC), is completely time-invariant and can be learned from a few demonstrations via solving two (convex) constrained quadratic optimization problems. We validate UMIC on a library of 30 human handwriting motions and on a set of experiments on 7-DoF KUKA light weight robot.},

    abstract = { We introduce a novel formulation of motion planning, for continuous-time trajectories, as probabilistic inference. We first show how smooth continuous-time trajectories can be represented by a small number of states using sparse Gaussian process (GP) models. We next develop an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm that exploits this sparsity and GP interpolation. We call this algorithm the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP). We then detail how motion planning problems can be formulated as probabilistic inference on a factor graph. This forms the basis for GPMP2, a very efficient algorithm that combines GP representations of trajectories with fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we extend GPMP2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP2, that can efficiently replan when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several sampling-based and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP2 is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We also benchmark iGPMP2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP2 to replan from scratch. }

We present an approach which allows robots to learn such motions from a few human demonstrations. The motions are encoded as rollouts of a dynamical system on a Riemannian manifold. Additional structure is imposed which guarantees smooth convergent motions to a goal location. The aforementioned structure involves viewing motions on an observed Riemannian manifold as deformations of straight lines on a latent Euclidean space. The observed and latent spaces are related through a diffeomorphism. Thus, this paper presents an approach for learning flexible diffeomorphisms, resulting in a stable dynamical system.  The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through validation on an established benchmark as well demonstrations collected on a real-world robotic system.}

    abstract = {Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning.Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large (maybe infinite) set of tasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states. At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained such that when it takes as input the first demonstration demonstration and a state sampled from the second demonstration, it should predict the action corresponding to the sampled state. At test time, a full demonstration of a single instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is expected to perform well on new instances of this new task. Our experiments show that the use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We anticipate that by training this model on a much greater variety of tasks and settings, we will obtain a general system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks.},
